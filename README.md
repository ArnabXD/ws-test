```
I have been using react-query for a long time to handle async operations and jotai/zustand/context api for global states, In my current organization, they are also not a fan of redux so I was never forced to learn it, and as I myself disliked redux, I didn't pick it up either. So this test was really challenging to me due to time factor & I liked the learning process. Thanks :)

This is my first task with redux ecosystem. So things might not be perfect.
